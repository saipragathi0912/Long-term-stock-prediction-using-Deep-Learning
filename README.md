# Long Term Stock Prediction using Deep Learning

## Description

**Long Term Stock Prediction using Deep Learning** is an ambitious project that aims to predict key performance indicators of a stock by leveraging deep learning techniques. This project focuses on capturing the long-term performance of a company by analyzing financial statements and using advanced machine learning models to make predictions about a stock's future indicators.

## Frameworks and Modules Used

- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow is a popular open-source deep learning framework widely used for building and training neural networks. It forms the foundation for the deep learning models in this project.

- **Pickle**: The Pickle module is used for serializing and deserializing Python objects. It can be helpful for saving and loading trained models or data structures efficiently.

- **Word2Vec**: Word2Vec is a technique for word embedding in natural language processing. In this project, Word2Vec might be used for encoding financial statement data or other textual information.

- **Keras**: Keras is an integral part of TensorFlow and provides a high-level API for building and training neural networks. It simplifies the development of deep learning models.

- **NumPy**: NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computations in Python. It plays a crucial role in handling and manipulating data, especially in the context of deep learning.
